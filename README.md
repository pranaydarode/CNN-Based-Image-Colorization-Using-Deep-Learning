# CNN-Based-Image-Colorization-Using-Deep-Learning

Project Titles: Build CNN for image colorization using Deep Transfer Learning

Abstract:
Image colorization is a challenging task that involves predicting the colours of a grayscale image. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for image colorization, but existing CNN-based models often generate unrealistic or colour-inconsistent results.

This project aims to develop a novel CNN architecture for image colorization that can produce high-quality and realistic colourized images. The proposed model is based on a multi-scale residual encoder-decoder framework, which incorporates a variety of techniques to improve the colorization performance, including:

●	A multi-scale feature extraction module to capture rich image features at different scales.

●	A residual encoder-decoder framework to learn long-range contextual dependencies and to preserve the spatial information of the input image.

●	A novel attention mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most important image regions during colorization.

The proposed model is trained on a large dataset of grayscale and colourized image pairs. Once trained, the model can be used to colourize grayscale images in real time.
